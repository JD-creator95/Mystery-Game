========================================

Investigation commenced.
Reviewing crime scene details...

--- Questioned: DR. ELEANOR HAYES (Museum Curator (15 years at the museum)) ---
Time: 17:05:00

🔍 CLUE DISCOVERED: TORN RED FABRIC
   A small piece of red wool fabric, approximately 2 inches long, caught on the rough edge of the door handle. The fabric appears to be from a scarf or sweater. Lab analysis confirms it's from an expensive cashmere blend.

🔍 CLUE DISCOVERED: ALIBI PHOTOGRAPHS
   Photographs from a charity gala on the night of the theft show Dr. Eleanor Hayes wearing a distinctive red cashmere scarf. The event was from 7:00 PM to 11:00 PM, but her whereabouts between midnight and 6:00 AM are unaccounted for.• Not all clues directly implicate the guilty party - some may be red herrings• Consider means (access), motive (reason), and opportunity (time/ability)• Cross-reference clues with suspect statements to find contradictions• The real culprit will have the strongest combination of all three elements• Some suspects may be lying to protect themselves even if they're innocent

--- Questioned: MARCUS COLE (Head Security Guard (7 years at the museum)) ---
Time: 17:05:03

🔍 CLUE DISCOVERED: MUDDY FOOTPRINTS
   Size 10 men's shoe prints in a distinctive pattern. The mud contains traces of clay soil common to residential gardens in the upscale Riverside district. Prints show the person walked deliberately, not running.

🔍 CLUE DISCOVERED: SECURITY FOOTAGE GAP
   Security cameras were manually disabled from 2:00 AM to 3:30 AM. The system logs show they were turned off using a master override code that only three people possess: Dr. Hayes (curator), Marcus Cole (head security guard), and Sarah Mitchell (assistant curator).

--- Questioned: SARAH MITCHELL (Assistant Curator (3 years at the museum)) ---
Time: 17:05:05

🔍 CLUE DISCOVERED: STOLEN KEY CARD
   Sarah Mitchell's employee access card, which grants access to all museum doors and can disable certain alarms. Sarah reported it missing two days before the theft but claimed she thought she'd just misplaced it at home.

🔍 CLUE DISCOVERED: FINANCIAL RECORDS
   Bank records show that one of the suspects recently received a wire transfer of $50,000 from an offshore account belonging to Victor Blackwood, a notorious private collector known for acquiring items through questionable means.

Reviewed evidence. Total clues gathered: 6
