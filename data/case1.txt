THE MYSTERY OF THE STOLEN SAPPHIRE
===================================

CRIME SCENE: The Grand Museum Heist
------------------------------------

Location: The Metropolitan Museum of Natural History
Time: Between 2:00 AM and 3:30 AM, November 15th
Victim: The Museum (theft of the "Azure Heart" sapphire)

THE INCIDENT:

On the morning of November 15th, security guard Marcus Cole discovered that the museum's prized possession, the Azure Heart sapphire (valued at $2.5 million), had been stolen from its display case in the East Wing. The case's glass had been carefully removed, not shattered, suggesting the thief had professional knowledge of the security system.

CRIME SCENE DETAILS:

The East Wing houses the museum's gemstone collection. The Azure Heart was displayed in a climate-controlled glass case with a state-of-the-art alarm system. The alarm was deactivated at 2:07 AM using the curator's override code. Security cameras in the corridor were mysteriously turned off between 2:00 AM and 3:30 AM.

The back entrance door was found unlocked when Marcus arrived for his morning shift at 6:00 AM. No signs of forced entry were detected. The alarm system logged the curator's access code being used, but Dr. Eleanor Hayes claims she was at home during that time.

EVIDENCE AT THE SCENE:

• The display case was opened cleanly - no broken glass
• Muddy footprints (size 10 men's shoes) leading from the back door to the East Wing
• A small piece of red fabric caught on the door handle of the back entrance
• The security system showed Dr. Hayes' access code was used to disable the alarm
• A half-empty coffee cup on the security desk (guard's post was briefly unattended)
• Scratches around the back door lock, suggesting it may have been picked

THE INVESTIGATION BEGINS:

As the detective on this case, you must question the suspects, examine the evidence, and determine who stole the Azure Heart sapphire. Each suspect has a motive, but only one is guilty. Can you solve the mystery?
