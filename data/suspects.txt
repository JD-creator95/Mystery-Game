SUSPECT PROFILES AND STATEMENTS
================================

SUSPECT #1: DR. ELEANOR HAYES
==============================
Age: 52
Occupation: Museum Curator (15 years at the museum)
Appearance: Professional, always impeccably dressed, wears designer scarves

BACKGROUND:
Dr. Hayes has dedicated her life to the museum. She personally acquired the Azure Heart sapphire for the collection three years ago. Recently divorced, she's been struggling financially due to legal fees and splitting assets. Despite her financial troubles, colleagues describe her as fiercely protective of the museum's collection.

OFFICIAL STATEMENT:
"I was home all night on November 14th. I attended a charity gala earlier that evening but left around 11:00 PM. I went straight home and was in bed by midnight. Yes, I own a red cashmere scarf - I wore it to the gala. But I definitely had it with me when I got home. I hung it on my coat rack.

As for my access code being used - someone must have stolen it! I change my password quarterly as required, but perhaps someone hacked the system. I would never steal from my own museum. The Azure Heart is like a child to me. I worked for two years to negotiate its acquisition.

The financial troubles? Yes, I'm going through a difficult divorce, but I would never compromise my integrity. I've already spoken with my lawyer about this ridiculous accusation."

MOTIVE: Severe financial difficulties due to divorce, could sell the sapphire on the black market
MEANS: Has master access codes and intimate knowledge of the security system
ALIBI: Claims to have been home alone (no witnesses after 11 PM)


SUSPECT #2: MARCUS COLE
========================
Age: 34
Occupation: Head Security Guard (7 years at the museum)
Appearance: Fit, military background, size 10 shoes

BACKGROUND:
Marcus is a former military police officer who served two tours overseas. He's known for being thorough and professional. However, he's been working double shifts to pay off gambling debts. His wife recently left him, taking their daughter, citing his gambling problem as the reason.

OFFICIAL STATEMENT:
"I was on duty that night, but I didn't see or hear anything unusual. Yes, I left my post briefly around 2:15 AM - I needed to use the restroom and grab a coffee. I was gone maybe 10 minutes, 15 at most.

When I came back, everything looked normal. I didn't notice anything wrong until my morning perimeter check at 6:30 AM when I found the back door unlocked. That's when I went to check the East Wing and discovered the sapphire was gone.

The security cameras? I don't know why they were off. That shouldn't be possible unless someone used the master override. I didn't touch them. Sure, I have the code, but I didn't use it. And yes, I wear size 10 shoes - so do millions of other men!

Look, I've got problems, I admit it. Gambling debts, a failed marriage. But I'm not a thief. This job is all I have left."

MOTIVE: Significant gambling debts ($75,000), desperate for money
MEANS: Has master override codes, knows security blind spots, left post unattended
ALIBI: Was supposed to be on duty but left post unattended during critical time


SUSPECT #3: SARAH MITCHELL
===========================
Age: 28
Occupation: Assistant Curator (3 years at the museum)
Appearance: Young, ambitious, fashionable, recently purchased expensive car

BACKGROUND:
Sarah is a talented young curator who studied art history at an Ivy League university. She's ambitious and has expressed frustration about the slow pace of promotions. Recently, she's been living beyond her means - designer clothes, a new luxury car, expensive apartment. Colleagues have noticed but assumed her wealthy family was supporting her.

OFFICIAL STATEMENT:
"I left the museum at my usual time, around 6:00 PM on November 14th. I went home, had dinner, watched a movie, and went to bed. I live alone, so no one can confirm that, but it's the truth.

My key card went missing two days before the theft. I reported it to Dr. Hayes immediately! I thought maybe I dropped it at home, but I searched everywhere. I assumed it would turn up. I never imagined someone would use it to commit a crime.

The expensive purchases? My grandmother passed away six months ago and left me an inheritance. I decided to treat myself. Is that a crime? I work hard, and I deserved something nice.

I don't know anything about the theft. I'm as shocked as everyone else. Why would I steal from the museum? I love my job here. This is my career!"

MOTIVE: Living beyond her means despite modest salary, recently acquired unexplained wealth
MEANS: Her stolen key card was used in the crime, has detailed knowledge of museum layout
ALIBI: Claims to have been home alone (no witnesses)


THE TRUTH (FOR GAME MASTER ONLY):
==================================

**GUILTY PARTY: SARAH MITCHELL**

Sarah has been secretly working with Victor Blackwood, the private collector. She deliberately "lost" her key card and gave Blackwood the security override codes in exchange for the $50,000 payment. She also borrowed Dr. Hayes' red scarf from the coat room earlier and wore men's shoes (borrowed from a male friend) to throw off suspicion.

The plan: Sarah provided access and codes, Blackwood sent a professional thief (wearing size 10 shoes) who committed the actual theft. Sarah receives an additional $200,000 once the sapphire is sold.

Evidence against her:
- Her key card was used
- The $50,000 payment (she claimed grandmother's inheritance)
- She had opportunity to steal Dr. Hayes' access code
- She had detailed knowledge of security protocols
- Her expensive purchases started before her "grandmother's inheritance"
